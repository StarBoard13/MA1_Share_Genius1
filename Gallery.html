    <h2>Tail grab:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Find a small jump and approach the jump in a stable speed that you are comfortable with.</li>
        <li>As you reach the lip of the jump pop off of the jump (extend your legs to get more air).</li>
        <li>Once in the air pull your knees up into your chest to make your skis easier to grab.</li>
        <li>Reach down with your hand and grab the tail of your ski, hold it until you are about to land.</li>
        <li>Let go of the skis and extend your legs into a stable position ready to land.</li>

        <li>As you reach the lip of the jump rotate your upper body in the direction you are spinning (Leading with your shoulders).</li>
        <li>Right before takeoff pop and swing your arms in the direction you are spinning to help gain momentum</li>
        <li>tuck in your legs a little to help maintain balance.</li>

        <li>As you reach the lip pop hard and throw your head and shoulders back initiating the flip.</li>
        <li>Bring your knees into your chest and tuck to rotate faster, as you come around spot your landing.</li>

        <li>As you reach the lip slightly pop and try to land onthe rail with both skis parallel and centered over it.</li>
        <li>Keep your weight centered and keep your knees bended to help balance on the rail.</li>
